# Objective

To Implement generic Machine Learning Algorithms over an Image Classifier

Optimise them to yield the maximum efficiency possible.
Evaluate them using various parameters and metrics.
Compare them against each other using metrics such as Accuracy and Time taken to Train and time taken to Predict.
Also comparing by using self-defined metrics such as Train-Efficiency and Predict- Efficiency.â€©
